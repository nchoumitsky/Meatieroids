Meatieroids

An Asteroids clone for XNA

This was a college project by Dan Aronds, Nick Choumitsky, and Lauren Domingo.  As our senior design project, we decided to create a game using the XNA framework.  This required us to learn C# as well as the XNA API - neither of which were used in any classes we had taken.

Unfortunately, the code at the end of the project was hosted on a student share of the Rutgers servers which has been deleted.  After the semester ended, I spent some time modifying the code.  There were few changes, but the code initially uploaded includes those changes.
